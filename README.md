## Project Description
This project takes information from a kaggle dataset csv that has information about different data professional jobs from 2020 to 2023. I explored this data with a focus on the salary, job category, and experience level dimensions. The job category was created by group similar job title based on the description of the roles when I googled it. The three job categories are data analyst, data engineer, and data scientist. All of my calculations and visualizations were using the tidyverse collection of packages.
